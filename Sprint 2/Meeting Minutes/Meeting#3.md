### Summary of Discussion  

We discussed the new task breakdown for the upcoming sprint. We also discussed potential improvements we can make for the next sprint.
This included making the UI more personalized and styled, as well as potentially updating the preferences layout and allowing multiple dietary preferences to be selected. 
We talked about the layout of our recipe page and what features we'd like it to have. We decided we will try to implement a page to create recipes, search and filter, 
and a main recipe display page. We divided the workload into user stories and split the tasks among members. Kaue and Jalen will work on the frontend, and Gayane Lasmar and Zeidan 
will help develop the backend. We also assigned Youssef to create the acceptance tests and to create the CI/CD pipeline and assist with extra tasks.
