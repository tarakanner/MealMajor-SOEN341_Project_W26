Project Description – MealMajor

MealMajor is a web-based meal preparation and healthy living planner designed primarily for university students. The goal of the project is to help users organize their meals efficiently, make healthier food choices, and simplify weekly meal planning by centralizing recipes, dietary preferences, and scheduling in a single platform.

The application allows users to create personal accounts where they can manage their dietary preferences and allergies. Users can create, edit, and search recipes based on attributes such as ingredients, preparation time, cost, difficulty level, and dietary tags. MealMajor also provides a weekly meal planner that enables users to assign recipes to specific days of the week and meal types (breakfast, lunch, dinner, or snack), ensuring better structure and consistency in meal planning while preventing duplicate meals within the same week.

This project is developed following an Agile methodology, using the Scrum framework over four incremental sprints. GitHub is used to support version control, issue tracking, task management, documentation, and continuous integration. Due to the limited duration of the course, the outcome is not expected to be a fully market-ready product, but rather a middle-fidelity prototype that demonstrates core functionality, sound software design decisions, and effective teamwork.

By the midpoint of the semester, the team will propose and implement an additional feature that integrates with the existing system, emphasizing originality and innovation. The project focuses not only on implementing functional features, but also on practicing collaborative software development, agile planning, documentation, and traceable contributions.
