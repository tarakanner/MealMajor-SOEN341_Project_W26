### Summary of Discussion  

We discussed certain features we wanted to include in our website. These included a page to greet the user after login,
as well as automatically sending the user to the preferences page after a successful login.
We discussed the bug we had relating to the authentication service backend and frontend, and assigned Gayane and Kaue to work on
solving the issues.
We discussed the use of MongoDB Atlas for our project after Youssef set up the organization to make sure we were all on the same page.
We created additional issues following the identification of a problem with preference verification for the "Other" category of allergies.
